- Fix Ackknowledgement (add more people, make profiles linkable, and fix the typo)
- Use GitHub Actions properly like this: https://www.visualstudiogeeks.com/github/extensions/publish-vscode-extension-using-github-actions
- Copy test yaml file to "out" and use the right path
- Make the decoration themable, and configurable
- when file changes, should we parse again?!
